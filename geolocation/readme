Pick your geolocation provider - some are "faster" than others - pick one that makes an api call so that you don't have to maintain your own geolocation database.
 From the results you'll be able to get a short country code. Then on your script all you have to do is

<img src="/images/banner<?php echo $countryCode; ?>.png">
Code (markup):and it will automatically go and find the right banner. 
In my case it would look for bannerNZ
