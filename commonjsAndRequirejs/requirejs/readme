Remember: only use shim config for non-AMD scripts,
scripts that do not already call define(). The shim
config will not work correctly if used on AMD scripts.
The Shim configuration is a much needed upgrade to the Require.js core that allows Require.js to load non-AMD compatible scripts.  you can have a shim configuration in your main file like this:

   // Sets the configuration for your third party scripts that are not AMD compatible
  shim: {

      "backbone": {
          deps: ["underscore", "jquery"],
          exports: "Backbone"  //attaches "Backbone" to the window object
      }

  } // end Shim Configuration
